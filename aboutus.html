	<div id="body">Biker points since 2060</div>
	<div id="content"> The power of two wheels, a frame, chain, handlebar and a couple other nuts and bolts are beyond amazing.  Blind to the common eye is the power and simplicity of a bicycle.  Bicycles offer no long lines, no traffic jams, no massive bills, no lack of parking spaces, etc. The list goes on and on as well as the benefits on biking do too.  Biking is good for not just one's physical and mental state but also for your environmental impact.  Making one simple change in your commute can change you for the better. 

     A couple years ago after waiting endlessly for my mother to find the cars keys and my brother to tie his shoes, I decided to make a proactive decision.  Grabbing the garage keys, I dashed up the backyard steps, and in a fury opened the garage.  To my relief I spotted my bike.  Not only was I on time to school that day and many more to follow but also I found myself in a state of irreplaceable contentment throughout the remainder of my day. 

     Odds are that you drove or were driven to the spot you are sitting in right now.
